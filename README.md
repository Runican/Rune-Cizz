Hello there!

I'm Runic. I'm still new at learning programming and I'm starting with my first language Python using VS Code to write my programs. 
I wouldn't really call myself a junior programmer yet, I feel like I need to earn that title after finishing some small projects. 
So I'm hoping to learn what I can and make new stuff that no one probably use for practice. I hope I can be better at problem 
solving and gain more experience as I write more codes.

If you ever use one of my projects in the future, just sent an email and let me know what you did with it. 
It's always good to see how my code can be improved to be better or used in an entirely different way than what it was supposed to.

Cheers to you all!
